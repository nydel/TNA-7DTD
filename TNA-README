TNA is an Acronym for TNA's Not API
As in TNA's not /of/ API (Application Programming Interface) & not /an/ API.

The API exist to justify an antiquated paradigm under which non-free (i.e.
for slaves) softwware is not ubiquitously evil, insane, &or "come on, buddy."

We refer to the entire memetic trend of various manner of API masking an
ineffecient, silly & possibly dangerous closed-source simply as "The API" so
it sounds cool, like we're some sort of philosophical movement. And in a way,
we are indeed - philosophical, that is - not cool.

Additionally, the avoidance of misanthropy is of utmost import to any idea or
group that, necessarily, aims to replace the status quo. If you create then
distribute software, yet refuse to show me the source code, your motivation is
to avoid providing users like myself with proof that the software is not written
very well. Always. We refer to this group of people as being under the spell of
what we call "The API" and we do so for two reasons.

Firstly, it is important to remember that most people are reasonable, rational,
good human beings who are simply doing the best they can; it is not our brothers
and our sisters who subjugate through proprietary software distribution - no - 
it is The API. Secondly, naming the problem, as it relates to the solution that
we intend to provide, makes it visible. We must be active about making The API
and its influence visible because all things of status quo and evil hide in
plain sight.
